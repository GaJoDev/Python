# Study guide: Functions

This study guide provides a quick-reference summary of what you learned in this lesson and serves as a guide for the upcoming practice quiz.  

In the Functions segment, you learned how to define and call functions, utilize a function’s parameters, and return data from a function. You also learned how to differentiate and convert between different data types utilizing variables. Plus, you learned a few best practices for writing reusable and readable code. 
## Terms

- __return value__ - the value or variable returned as the end result of a function

- __parameter (argument)__ -  a value passed into a function for use within the function

- __refactoring code__ - a process to restructure code without changing functionality

## Knowledge

- The purpose of the `def()` keyword is to define a new function. 

- Best practices for writing code that is readable and reusable:

    - __Create a reusable function__ - Replace duplicate code with one reusable function to make the code easier to read and repurpose.

    - __Refactor code__ - Update code so that it is self-documenting and the intent of the code is clear.

    - __Add comments__ - Adding comments is part of creating self-documenting code. Using comments allows you to leave notes to yourself and/or other programmers to make the purpose of the code clear.

Coding skills

Skill Group 1

- Use a function that accepts multiple parameters

- Return a result value
```Python
# This function calculates the number of days in a variable number of 
# years, months, and days. These variables are provided by the user and
# are passed to the function through the function’s parameters.
def find_total_days(years, months, days):
# Assign a variable to hold the calculations for the number of days in
# a year (years*365) plus the number of days in a month (months*30) plus
# the number of days provided through the "days" parameter variable.
    my_days = (years*365) + (months*30) + days
# Use the "return" keyword to send the result of the "my_days"  
# calculation to the function call. 
    return my_days
 
# Function call with user provided parameter values. 
print(find_total_days(2,5,23))
```
Skill Group 2

- Use a function to return the result of a measurement conversion

- Use arithmetic operators to perform a calculation

- Combine text with a function call within a print() statement

- Convert the return value from a float data type to a string for the print() function

- Call the function and perform a calculation on the return value within a print() statement
```Python
# This function converts fluid ounces to milliliters and returns the 
# result of the conversion.
def convert_volume(fluid_ounce):
# Calculate value of the "ml" variable using the parameter variable 
# "fluid_ounce". There are approximately 29.5 milliliters in 1 fluid
# ounce.
    ml = fluid_ounce * 29.5  
# Return the result of the calculation.  
    return ml
 
# Call the conversion from within the print() function using 2 fluid 
# ounces. Convert the return value from a float to a string.  
print("The volume in milliliters is " + str(convert_volume(2)))
 
# Call the function again and double the 2 fluid ounces from within
# the print function.
print("The volume in milliliters is " + str(convert_volume(2)*2))
# Alternative calculation:
# print("The volume in milliliters is " + str(convert_volume(4))
```
