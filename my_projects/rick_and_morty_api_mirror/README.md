# Rick and Morty API Mirror

This project fetches data from the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and saves it locally to mirror the API data. It allows you to query the data from local JSON files rather than making frequent API calls, which is especially useful for testing and development purposes.
